## Bot commands

All commands are sent via **general map chat** (normal typing).
* Currently bot will also accept command across map even if you do normal chat (using follow command will teleport all bots you have spawned from other map to your location)

With multiple bots: target one specifically with a unique name-start prefix, full name, or slot number

```
stop - party wide stop
jason follow - only Jason will follow
bo come - only the unique bot whose name starts with "bo" will follow
1 stop - only bot slot 1 will stop
grind - party wide auto grind
jason stop - only jason will stop
```
