# Bot System — Quick Start Guide

## Features

- follow, trade, loot
- auto fight/grind, use skill, auto assign ap/sp, buffs (Only 1st jobs + select 2nd job configured/tested)
- auto buy/resupply potions/ammo if shop available within the same map
- auto share potions/ammo among themselves and to owner(if requested) when running low while farming
- auto equip and optimize own gear loadout - including chaining stats bonus to unlock higher requirement equips and weapons, allowing dexless/strless/lukless builds
- auto share equipment upgrades with owner and other sibling bots (auto compare stats directly against recipient's inventory)
- auto sort equipment from junk equip so selling trash equips become manageable. (auto sell may come later when I trust it enough to not sell something useful)
- auto complete any quest the owner turn in (with rewards)
- Party Quest Automation(currently only KPQ 1st stage + auto accept rewards 5th stage)
- Each bot is a real character you can log in as, can spawn your alts as bots

## Bot Maintenance Guide

1. Give them mesos, take them shopping to resupply pots/ammo - can also manually give a bot some excess and they will auto distribute among themselves.
2. use `inv?` command to check inventory spaces, `trade <equip/use/etc/...>` or `trade trash` to get those items(no auto sell for now)
3. use `brb` or `logout` command to send bot to town safely or despawn

## Creating a Bot

### Option 1: create default 
`@spawnbot <characterName> confirm`

### Option 2: register existing character
log in on the target character and run: `@registerbot <characterName>`

## Spawning a Bot

### Option 1: `@spawnbot <name>`

### Option 2: Buddy invite shortcut
Add bots as friends. Bots will always show up as online. Invite a bot to party or chatroom through buddy menu to spawn.

## Bot commands

All commands are sent via **general map chat** (normal typing).
* Currently bot will also accept command across map even if you do normal chat (using follow command will teleport all bots you have spawned from other map to your location)

With multiple bots: target one specifically with a unique name-start prefix, full name, or slot number

```
stop - party wide stop
jason follow - only Jason will follow
jas come - only the unique bot whose name starts with "jas" will follow
1 stop - only bot slot 1 will stop
grind - party wide auto grind
jason stop - only jason will stop
```

## Notes
- Bot characters can be logged into as normal accounts (user = bot name, password = `botbot`) to manually equip or manage inventory.

## Optional: LLM chat replies

Bots can hold short casual conversations with the owner using a tiny local model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Purely cosmetic/for fun, doesn't affect any existing command or serve any gameplay purpose whatsoever.

### Setup
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).
2. Download + Run a model (in PowerShell):

| Requirements | Command to run | RAM Usage | Expected Intelligence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decent CPU | `ollama run gemma4:e2b` | ~7 GB | Decent |
| Beefy CPU or Has GPU | `ollama run gemma4:e4b` | ~10+ GB | The more RAM the merrier |
3. Edit `src/main/java/server/bots/llm/BotLlmConfig.java`, set `enabled = true` and `model = xxxx` matching your selected model. Rebuild/Restart server.

### Behavior
- LLM only fires when a message is **directly addressed** to a specific bot by name (`Jason hi`, `Leroy how are you`).
- Each bot gets its own memory file at `bots/llm-memory/<botName>.jsonl` (gitignored). At 32 turns it auto-compacts the oldest to a 1-2 sentence `.summary.txt`.
